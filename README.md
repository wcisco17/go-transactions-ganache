# go-transactions-ganache

Sending and signing ether transactions using Ganache for testing, using golang 

(Still In Progress)

This project was written in go, and the main purpose was to test, send, and utilize the go-ethereum library to send transactions
directly with Ganache. Furthermore, I plan to handle these transactions directly using solidity using a test driven fashion before deploying. 



if you would like to run this file feel free to run `go run transactions.go`
